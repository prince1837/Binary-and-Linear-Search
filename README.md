# Binary-Search
its all about binary equation in Math. Basically we use a Math concept in it.

# Concept of this code.
Binary Search : In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomies divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time

We basically ignore half of the elements just after one comparison.

    Compare x with the middle element.
    If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index.
    Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
    Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half.
